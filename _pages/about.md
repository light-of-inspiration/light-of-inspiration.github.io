Hi, I am an __AI MSc student__ 👨🏻‍💻 from the University of Sussex, seeking for the chance of __becoming a PhD student__, to make further investigations in __AI & Law__.  


For prepartions, I've gained those related experience preliminarily:  
  
💻 __For AI in Law__:
* Programming with proficient Python 
* Legal software development & management
* Applying large language models (LLMs) in the Legal Q&A research

⚖️ __For Law in AI__:
* Skills for legal empirical research, with Machine Learing techniques
* Foregin language acquisition (English, Japanese, German), suitable for advanced comparative study
* Legal doctrine based research, especially in the prespective of technological essence

Becoming a interdisciplinary researcher of AI & Law has always been __my ideal__, for which I have been striving since my undergraduate time. Thus, I extremely hope to be given the chance, to continue my studies as a PhD student.

I am always been a dedicated and focused student, and is capable for continuous research process, and is also suitable for work in a laboratory, by maintaining good communication with other team members. 

Here are more details about my experience. Please feel free to __contact me__ at anytime, to discuss about any further possibilities for PhD application. I'm eagerly looking forward to discussing with you, about all those issues related to AI & Law 😃
