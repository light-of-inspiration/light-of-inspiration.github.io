Hi, I am an __AI MSc student__ üë®üèª‚Äçüíª from University of Sussex, seeking for a chance of __becoming a Ph.D. student__, to make further investigations in __AI & Law__.  

I've gained those primary skills for prepartion:  

> üíª __For AI in Law__:
> * Programming with proficient Python
> * Legal software development
> * Handling english engineering articles
> * Applying large language models (LLMs) in Legal Question Answering
>
> ‚öñÔ∏è __For Law in AI__:
> * Legal empirical research skills, with Machine Learing
> * Foreign language acquisition (English, Japanese, German), for comparative study
> * Legal dogmatics research, in the perspective of "technical essence"


‚ÄºÔ∏è Becoming a interdisciplinary researcher for AI & Law has always been my ideal.  
Thus, I extremely hope to be given the chance, to continue my study as a Ph.D. student.

Please feel free to __contact me__ at anytime, to discuss about any further possibilities.   
I'm eagerly looking forward to discussing with you about all those issues related to AI & Law üòÉ
